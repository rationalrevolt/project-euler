The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 +
... + 10^2 = 385.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,(1 + 2 +
... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the
squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
